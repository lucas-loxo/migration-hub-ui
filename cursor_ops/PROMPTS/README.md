# Cursor Prompts — Modular Commands

Each `.txt` file in this folder is a standalone Cursor command. Use them individually or combine them into larger build prompts. Keep prompts surgical and version-controlled.

Suggested workflow:
- Pin `/cursor_ops/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and this file in Cursor.
- Open the target file(s) and run one prompt at a time.

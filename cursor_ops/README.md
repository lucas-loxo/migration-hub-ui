# Cursor Ops — AI DevOps Layer

Purpose: Enforce consistent AI collaboration between ChatGPT, Cursor, and developers. All operating rules, prompts, and context live here and evolve with the codebase.

How to Use:
- Pin `/cursor_ops/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in Cursor.
- Reference prompts under `/cursor_ops/PROMPTS/` for focused, repeatable changes.

Notes:
- This folder is version-controlled. Update context whenever schema, architecture, or guardrails change.
